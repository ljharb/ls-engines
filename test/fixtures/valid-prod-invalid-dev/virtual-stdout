Valid node version range: >= 0.4

Currently available latest releases of each valid node major version: <node versions for above semver range>

Your “engines” field allows fewer node versions than your dependency graph does.

If you want to widen your support, you can run `ls-engines --save`, or manually add the following to your `package.json`:
"engines": {
  "node": ">= 0.4"
}
